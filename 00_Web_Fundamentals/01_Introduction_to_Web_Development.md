# 01 Introduction to Web Development

## 1. What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves everything from a simple static page of text to complex web applications like Facebook or Netflix.

### The Three Main Pillars
1.  **Frontend (Client-Side)**: What the user *sees* and *interacts* with.
    *   **HTML**: Structure (Skeleton)
    *   **CSS**: Style (Skin/Clothing)
    *   **JavaScript**: Interactivity (Brain/Muscle)
2.  **Backend (Server-Side)**: The logic that happens behind the scenes.
    *   Databases (storing data)
    *   Server logic (processing requests)
    *   API (communication between frontend and backend)
3.  **Full-Stack**: A combination of both Frontend and Backend development.

## 2. Tools You Need

To start coding, you need a professional environment. Here is the standard setup involved in modern web development:

### A. Code Editor (IDE)
The software where you write your code.
*   **Recommended**: **VS Code (Visual Studio Code)** - The industry standard. Fast, free, and packed with extensions.
*   *Alternatives*: Sublime Text, Atom.

### B. Web Browser
You need a browser to view and test your websites.
*   **Recommended**: **Google Chrome** (Great Developer Tools).
*   *Alternatives*: Firefox Developer Edition, Microsoft Edge.

### C. Version Control System
*   **Git**: A tool to track changes in your code (like a "Save Game" history).
*   **GitHub**: A cloud platform to store your Git projects online.

### D. Node.js (Optional for beginners, mandatory later)
*   A runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. Essential for running tools, servers, and package managers.

## 3. Setting Up Your Environment

1.  **Install VS Code**: Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  **Install Chrome**: Make sure you have the latest version.
3.  **Create a Workspace**:
    *   Create a folder on your computer (e.g., `Web_Dev_Course`).
    *   Open VS Code -> File -> Open Folder -> Select `Web_Dev_Course`.
4.  **Install Basic Extensions** in VS Code:
    *   *Live Server*: Automatically reloads your page when you save code.
    *   *Prettier*: Automatically formats your code to look clean.
    *   *Material Icon Theme*: Makes your file icons look great.

## 4. Your First "Hello World"

1.  Create a file named `index.html`.
2.  Type `!` and press **Tab** (This is an Emmet abbreviation to generate basic structure).
3.  Inside the `<body>` tag, type `<h1>Hello World</h1>`.
4.  Right-click and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
5.  Congratulations! You just built your first webpage.
